# Disease Recognition in Chest X-rays

Detecting Tuberculosis and Pneumonia Using Chest X-rays with a CNN Model

## Overview
This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for the automated detection of tuberculosis and pneumonia in chest X-ray images. Leveraging deep learning techniques, the model analyzes radiographic images to assist medical professionals in diagnosing these critical respiratory conditions.

## What I Learned
Throughout the project, I acquired a comprehensive understanding of various aspects related to disease recognition in chest X-rays. Key learning points include:

- **Data Collection**: I gained insights into the process of collecting a sizable dataset comprising over 10,000 chest X-ray images. This involved sourcing relevant data from diverse repositories and ensuring data integrity.

- **Image Pre-processing**: I learned the importance of image pre-processing techniques such as identifying and removing duplicates, adjusting resolution, and converting images into grayscale format. These steps are crucial for enhancing the quality of input data and optimizing model performance.

- **CNN Model Development**: Through experimentation, I explored the design and implementation of CNN architectures tailored for disease recognition tasks. This involved selecting the optimal number of layers, fine-tuning hyperparameters, and optimizing the overall architecture for efficient training and inference.

## Future Work
- **Enhanced Model Architectures**: Explore advanced CNN architectures and techniques such as transfer learning to further improve model accuracy and robustness.
- **Extended Dataset**: Continuously expand the dataset with additional annotated chest X-ray images to enhance the model's generalization capabilities.
- **Clinical Validation**: Collaborate with healthcare professionals to validate the model's performance and integrate it into clinical workflows for real-time disease detection.
